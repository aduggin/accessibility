# Accessibility statement

Lanchester City Council is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience. We actively work to ensure that this website is accessible and usable by people of all abilities.

If you experience any problem accessing the website then please feel free to contact us at accessibility@lanchester.gov.uk

## How to get the most accessible experience from this website
Our website can be viewed on a range of different screen sizes and the size of text can be changed to suit different people. We have also included a search facility, sitemap and glossary, to help people find information more easily.

### Changing Settings
AbilityNet provides guidance about how to set up your system to get better access to information. AbilityNet will help you to:
* make your mouse easier to use
* use your keyboard instead of a mouse
* talk to your device
* make your device talk to you
* make text larger
* change your colours
* magnify the screen

## Accessibility limitations		
Whilst we try to ensure accessibility, it is not always possible to do so in all areas of the website. The following areas are known to us as falling outside of our intended web accessibility targets:

* Geographic Information Systems (GIS) maps data
* Facebook, Flickr, Twitter and Instagram
* PDF documents

We will continue to investigate ways of improving the accessibility of these areas.

We are also aware that some of our third party applications do not conform to the same levels of accessibility. We have no control over the accessibility of these applications, however we will attempt to offer an accessible alternative.

## Contacting Us
We are always looking for ways to help people get the best experience from this website. If there is information you think should be included on this page, or if you experience any problem accessing the site then contact us at accessibility@lanchester.gov.uk.
