# Accessibility

Lanchester City Council is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience. We actively work to ensure that this website is accessible and usable by people of all abilities.

If you experience any problem accessing the website then please feel free to contact us at [accessibility@lanchester.gov.uk](mailto:accessibility@lanchester.gov.uk)

## Customise our site to your needs
The site has been created to be as broadly usable as possible for everyone as it is. If you have preferences or needs that are not supported without further modification you can use the following guidance:

* [make your mouse easier to use](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/making-your-mouse-easier-to-use/)
* [use your keyboard instead of a mouse](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/category/keyboard-shortcuts/)
* [talk to your device](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/talking-to-your-device/)
* [make your device talk to you](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/category/making-your-mobile-or-tablet-talk/)
* [make text larger](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/making-text-larger/)
* [change your colours](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/changing-your-colours/)
* [magnify the screen](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/magnifying-the-screen/)

## Limitations of this siteâ€™s accessibility		
Whilst we try to ensure accessibility, it is not always possible to do so in all areas of the website. The following areas are known to us as falling outside of our intended web accessibility targets:

* Geographic Information Systems (GIS) maps data
* Facebook, Flickr, Twitter and Instagram
* PDF documents

We will continue to investigate ways of improving the accessibility of these areas.

We are also aware that some of our third party applications do not conform to the same levels of accessibility. We have no control over the accessibility of these applications, however we will attempt to offer an accessible alternative.

## Contacting Us
We are always looking for ways to help people get the best experience from this website. If there is information you think should be included on this page, or if you experience any problem accessing the site then contact us at accessibility@lanchester.gov.uk.

To assist us understand your difficulty quickly, it would help us if you would provide the information advised in [Contacting organizations about inaccessible websites](http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/inaccessible) in your request.

Conformity to these guidelines also makes websites more user friendly for all people.

Our website has been evaluated for accessibility by the [Digital Accessibility Centre](http://www.digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/). An accessibility expert review was performed on all our pages templates and tested by people with a wide range of disabilities.
