# Accessibility Statement

Radborough City Council is committed to making our websites and applications accessible to all our users and have an ongoing programme of making useful updates and improvements.

## Accessibility conformance
Our website partially conforms with level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. These guidelines are the internationally recognized benchmark for building accessible websites and explain how to make websites more accessible for people with disabilities.

We strive to achieve and maintain levels of accessibility that conform to the AA standard, but it is very hard for a 6,000+ page website to maintain such compliance. Due to budget constraints and not having an in-house development team we are unable to fix many of the problems.

We will ensure we fully conform with WCAG 2.0 AA when the website undergoes it’s next redesign. This is planned for 2021.

## Evaluation Methodology
To test for conformance we use the siteimprove accessibility testing tool which we run against all 6000 pages on the websites.  We have also had an accessibility audit provided by the Digital Accessibility Centre where an accessibility expert reviewed our 10 most people page templates and a team of disabled users tested core user journeys with a range of assistive technologies.

## Inaccessible content
Our website does not meet the following WCAG 2.0 success criteria

### 1.1.1 – Non-text Content  
There are a number of images on the website that are missing alternative text or have text that is in appropriate. Work is ongoing to fix these.

### 1.2.2 – Captions    
Most videos on the website do not have captions. We unfortunatley do not have the budget to add captions to our videos.

### 1.2.3 – Audio Description 
None of our videos that communicate informaton visually have either an audio description or a text alternative.

### 1.3.1 – Info and Relationships
Some of the text on the website does not meet the minimum colour contrast of 4.5:1

### 2.1.1 – Keyboard
Some of the features on the website are not accessible with a keyboard. This is due to the incorrect HTML markup being used. We do not have an in-house developer that can fix these for us.

### 2.4.4 – Link Purpose (In Context)    

Some of the link's purpose is not clear from it's content. We have a number of links that use text such as 'click here' and 'read more'. Work is ongoing to fix these.

### 3.3.1 – Error Identification    
Some of our forms do not have error messages that clearly identify input errors. We do not have an in-house developer that can fix these for us.

### 3.3.3 – Error Suggestion 
Some of our forms do not have error messages that suggest fixes when users make errors. We do not have an in-house developer that can fix these for us.


### 4.1.2 – Name, Role, Value    
Some parts of the website have not been built using the correct HTML markup - this includes our autocomplete, sliders and help buttons. We do not have an in-house developer that can fix these for us.
