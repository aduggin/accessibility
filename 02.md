# Accessibility Statement

Radborough City Council is committed to making our websites and applications accessible to all our users and have an ongoing programme of making useful updates and improvements.

## Accessibility conformance
Our website partially conforms with level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. These guidelines are the internationally recognized benchmark for building accessible websites and explain how to make websites more accessible for people with disabilities.

We strive to achieve and maintain levels of accessibility that conform to the AA standard, but it is very hard for a 6,000+ page website to maintain such compliance. Due to budget constraints and not having an in-house development team we are unable to fix many of the problems.

We will ensure we fully conform with WCAG 2.0 AA when the website undergoes itâ€™s next redesign. This is planned for 2021.

## Evaluation Methodology
To test for conformance we use the siteimprove accessibility testing tool which we run against all 6000 pages on the websites.  We have also had an accessibility audit provided by the Digital Accessibility Centre where an accessibility expert reviewed our 10 most people page templates and a team of disabled users tested core user journeys with a range of assistive technologies.

## Accessibility limitations
Our website does not meet the following WCAG 2.0 success criteria
